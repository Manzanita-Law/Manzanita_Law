        <p>

          I began my legal career as corporate counsel at Alliant Insurance Services, Inc., a major specialty insurance brokerage, and recently worked for Tealium Inc., a Saas customer data platform provider. As an associate with Clerkin, Sinclair &
          Mahfouz LLP, a small law firm representing clients in a broad range of industries, I focused on transactional matters, including corporate governance, contract negotiation and drafting, regulatory compliance, employment, and intellectual
          property licensing. My pro bono work has included advising on obtaining recognition of non-profit status and speaking on entity formation.
        </p>

        <p>
          I received a B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania and a J.D. from the University of California Irvine School of Law, and am admitted to practice in California. I am CIPP/US certified.
        </p>
        <p>
          I serve on the advisory board of San Diego non-profit Women of Color in Law, and have previously served as a board member of the South Asian Bar Association of San Diego. Iâ€™m a member of the San Diego County Bar Association.
        </p>
        <p>


          I speak Spanish and Gujarati. Outside of work, I like to spend time in nature with my dog.
