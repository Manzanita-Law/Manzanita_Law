          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <h2>Dated January 1, 2025</h2>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy for Manzanita Law PC (the "Firm" or "we")
            explains how we handle personal data that we collect from you. For
            purposes of this Privacy Policy, "personal data" refers to
            information that directly or indirectly identifies an individual.
            Aggregated or de-identified information is not personal data, and we
            use aggregated or de-identified information as we deem appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may collect your personal data directly from you through your
            interactions with the Firm, whether by email or through other
            communication methods, and including when you receive legal services
            from us. We may also receive your personal data indirectly,
            including from our clients (for example, if you are involved in a
            transaction with one of the Firm's clients) or from third parties
            (for example, from our payment processor when you pay for legal
            services rendered, or from another professional who put us in touch
            with each other, or from social media platforms such as LinkedIn).
            We do not use cookies or similar technology to track your
            interaction with our website.
          </p>
          <p>
            We process your personal data to determine whether to engage in a
            business relationship with you, to provide you services if you have
            engaged the Firm to represent you, send you information or respond
            to your requests or comments, operate our website and business,
            identify and troubleshoot errors, protect against or investigate or
            respond to misuse of our services, or to enforce our legal rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may share your personal data with third parties upon your
            request, or with vendors who assist us in providing our services or
            in our business operations (for example, to an independent
            contractor providing administrative support), or as required by
            applicable law. Such sharing may involve the transfer of personal
            data.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the course of your interactions with the Firm, we may provide you
            with links to or access to websites or software that are not
            controlled by us, and accordingly, those sites or software are
            subject to applicable terms of service or privacy policies, not this
            Privacy Policy. Please contact the operator of the relevant website
            or software if you have questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have entered into an engagement letter, and the terms of such
            engagement letter conflict with the provisions in this Privacy
            Policy, the engagement letter will control to the extent of such
            conflict.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do our best to protect your personal data from unauthorized use
            or disclosure but we cannot make any guarantees about your personal
            data. If you believe your data has been breached by us or through
            your use of our services, please contact us.
          </p>
          <p>
            To access, correct, update, or delete your personal information,
            please contact us and we will do so if feasible. Circumstances in
            which we may not be able to meet your request include the Firm
            needing to retain or continue to process your personal data for our
            legitimate interest or to comply with legal obligations. The Firm
            does not discriminate against anyone who exercises their rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not knowingly collect personal data of children. If you are
            the parent or legal guardian of a minor and have reason to believe
            that we are in possession of personal data of your child, please
            contact us.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Firm retains personal data as long as provided in the engagement
            letter, if there is one, or otherwise as long as reasonably
            necessary in connection with our business relationship with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may make changes to this Privacy Policy as we deem appropriate.
            The most current version of this Privacy Policy will be posted on
            our website.
